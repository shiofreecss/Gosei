   Or to run setup and start in one command:
   ```
   npm run start-with-copy
   ```

5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## Building for Production

To build the application for production:

```
npm run build-with-copy
```

The build artifacts will be stored in the `build/` directory.

## Usage

### Uploading SGF Files

1. Click on the drop area or use the file browser to select an SGF file
2. The game will be loaded and displayed on the board

### Browsing the Game Library

1. Click on "Game Library" in the header
2. Browse games by category, subcategory, or tournament
3. Use pagination controls to navigate through multiple games
4. Search for specific games using the search bar
5. Click on a game to load and display it in the viewer

### Using Japanese Kifu Format

You can paste traditional Japanese kifu format directly into the text area. Example format:

```
# 棋譜（Japanese Kifu Format）
# 黒：Takemiya Masaki
# 白：Cho Chikun
# 日付: 1986-02-27
# 結果: 黒の中押し勝ち

1. 黒: Q16
2. 白: D4
3. 黒: Q4
...
```

The application will automatically convert this to SGF format for visualization.

### Navigating through the Game

- Use the navigation controls below the board to move through the game
- First/Last buttons jump to the beginning/end of the game
- Prev/Next buttons move one move at a time
