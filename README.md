- **Styling**: CSS
- **Deployment**: Netlify
- **Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library

## Performance Optimizations

GoSei | AI-Kifu includes several performance optimizations to ensure smooth and responsive user experience:

### Game Library Organization
- Hierarchical category structure for intuitive navigation
- Games organized into subcategories for easier browsing
- Efficient search across the entire game database

### Caching Mechanisms
- SGF files are cached after first load to prevent redundant network requests
- Game lists are cached by tournament to reduce API calls
- Preloading of game data for faster navigation

### React Optimizations
- Component memoization using React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- useCallback and useMemo hooks for optimized rendering of the Go board
- Efficient state management for smooth interaction

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or later recommended)
- npm (v6 or later)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AI-Kifu.git
   cd AI-Kifu
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up game data:
   ```
   npm run setup
   ```

```
npm run build-with-copy
```

The build artifacts will be stored in the `build/` directory.

## Usage

### Uploading SGF Files

1. Click on the drop area or use the file browser to select an SGF file
2. The game will be loaded and displayed on the board

### Browsing the Game Library

1. Click on "Game Library" in the header
2. Browse games by category, subcategory, or tournament
3. Use pagination controls to navigate through multiple games
4. Search for specific games using the search bar
5. Click on a game to load and display it in the viewer

### Using AI Analysis Features

1. Load a game from the library or upload your own SGF file
2. In the display settings panel, toggle the analysis features you want to use:
   - Win Rate Chart
   - Liberty Analysis
   - Influence Heatmap
3. For the Win Rate Chart, select your preferred analysis method:
   - Liberty Analysis: Based on stone liberties and group connections
   - Influence Analysis: Based on territorial control and board position
4. Use the navigation controls to see how these metrics change during the game

### Using Japanese Kifu Format

You can paste traditional Japanese kifu format directly into the text area. Example format:

```
# Ê£ãË≠úÔºàJapanese Kifu FormatÔºâ
# ÈªíÔºöTakemiya Masaki
# ÁôΩÔºöCho Chikun
# Êó•‰ªò: 1986-02-27
# ÁµêÊûú: Èªí„ÅÆ‰∏≠Êäº„ÅóÂãù„Å°

1. Èªí: Q16
2. ÁôΩ: D4
3. Èªí: Q4
...
```

The application will automatically convert this to SGF format for visualization.

### Navigating through the Game

- Use the navigation controls below the board to move through the game
- First/Last buttons jump to the beginning/end of the game
- Prev/Next buttons move one move at a time
- Comments for moves will be displayed when available
